    <h2>Steps to Make the Dish</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Start the soup: Place chicken pieces 
            in a large pot; add chicken stock, 
            onions, celery, and salt. Bring to 
            a boil over medium-low heat, then 
            simmer, partially covered, until 
            chicken is tender, about 15 to 20 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the dumplings: Beat egg 
            and milk together in a large mixing bowl. 
            Mix in 1 cup flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Grate cold butter into the wet flour 
            mixture; stir in parsley.</li>
        <li>Dollop 6 large spoonfuls of dumpling 
            mixture onto the top of the simmering 
            chicken. Cover the pot and steam dumplings 
            until fluffy, 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove dumplings and chicken pieces 
            to a large dish; shred chicken and 
            discard bones. Cover and set aside, 
            keeping warm.</li>
        <li>For the gravy: Strain stock left in the pot, 
            pressing the vegetables to release more 
            flavor; return stock to the pot.</li>
        <li>Whisk water with remaining 1/2 cup flour until 
            smooth; stir into the strained stock. 
            Season with pepper and bring to a boil, 
            stirring constantly, to thicken.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken and top with dumplings.</li>
        <li>Serve with parsley and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
